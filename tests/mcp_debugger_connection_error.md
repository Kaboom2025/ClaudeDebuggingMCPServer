# MCP Python Debugger Connection Error

## Issue
When using the MCP Python debugger to debug a Flask application, encountered connection issues after hitting a breakpoint.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Started debug session for `tests/app.py`
2. Set breakpoint at line 13 (successfully set)
3. Made POST request to Flask app with curl
4. Request hung indefinitely (expected - breakpoint was hit)
5. Attempted to check call stack or variables
6. Got error: "Session not found, not connected, or no active thread"

## Error Details
- Session ID: `6447badc-2b8c-4e79-ba1d-15290d02f3ac`
- Error message: `MCP error -32602: Session 6447badc-2b8c-4e79-ba1d-15290d02f3ac not found, not connected, or no active thread`
- Session still shows as "running" in list_debug_sessions

## Expected Behavior
After hitting breakpoint, should be able to:
- Get call stack
- Inspect variables
- Step through code
- Continue execution

## Actual Behavior
- Breakpoint is hit (curl request hangs)
- Cannot interact with paused execution
- MCP debugger reports connection/thread issues

## Additional Error (Second Attempt)
When trying to attach debugger to user-owned Flask process:
- New session ID: `4a3b8b4d-0b58-4779-a7c4-0d601084f10b`
- Error setting breakpoint: "Server[pid=36007] disconnected unexpectedly"
- Suggests MCP debugger has issues connecting to external Python processes

## Solution Implemented
Added new `attach_to_debugpy` tool and enhanced DAP initialization with:
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Better connection validation
- Improved thread/frame management
- Robust error handling

## Usage Instructions for User-Controlled Debugging

### Step 1: Start Flask app with debugpy in your terminal
```bash
cd /Users/saalik/Documents/Projects/debugclaudecodemain/debugclaudecode
python3 -m debugpy --listen localhost:5678 --wait-for-client tests/app.py
```

### Step 2: Attach to the debugpy session
Use the MCP tool:
```
mcp__python-debug__attach_to_debugpy with:
- script_path: /path/to/your/script.py  
- port: 5678 (optional, defaults to 5678)
```

### Key Points
- Your Flask server runs on port 5001 (normal Flask port)
- Debugpy listens on port 5678 (debug protocol port) 
- You maintain full control of your server process
- MCP debugger only connects to the debug protocol, doesn't manage the process

## Test Results
- Connection attempts fail if Flask server not started with debugpy
- Need to ensure `--wait-for-client` flag is used when starting with debugpy
